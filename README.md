# Automation-Script This a script I wrote to help my department obtain houly updates of data that we were only getting on daily basis prior. This was important because we were needing more timely information than what our data warehouse was able to provide. Every website will be different in that different elements will need to be pointed to in order to achieve the download of the data needed. Once the data is downloaded I wrote a separate script that finds the latest excel download and loads it into an Access database which can be used storage for the Tableau reports that reference the data.
